* The Five Rules

** The Law of Car
The primitive car is defined only for non-empty lists.

** The Law of Cdr
The primitive cdr is defined only for non-empty lists. The cdr of any
non-empty list is always another list.

** The Law of Cons
The primitive cons takes two arguments. The second argument to cons
must be a list. The result is a list.

** The Law of Null?
The primitive null? is defined only for lists.

** The Law of Eq?
The primitive eq? takes two arguments. Each must be a non-numeric atom.
